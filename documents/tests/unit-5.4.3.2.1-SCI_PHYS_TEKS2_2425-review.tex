\question 
A satellite is launched into frictionless space. True or false? Once in space, the amount of force needed to keep the satellite moving at a constant speed is at least 1 newton. Explain

\ifprintanswers
\else
\fillwithlines{2cm}
\fi

\begin{solution}
    According to the law of inertia, once in motion the satellite will remain in motion at a constant velocity. Therefore, no force is required to keep it in motion. The statement is false. 
\end{solution}

For each diagram below, the box is the identical and the force $F$ is applied by various angles above the horizontal. In Diagrams A and C, force $F$ is applied at \ang{45} from the horizontal.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \draw (0,0) -- (3,0) node[below,pos=0.5] {Diagram A};

\begin{solution}
    The magnitudes of acceleration are equal for Diagrams A and C. The greatest acceleration occurs for Diagram B.

\question
A storm chaser flying a drone at \SI{21}{m/s} accelerates it at \SI{2.0}{m/s^2} for \SI{5.0}{s}. What is the drone's speed at the end of this time interval?


\begin{solution}
\begin{equation*}
    a = \frac{\Delta v}{\Delta t} = \frac{v_f - v_0}{\Delta t}
\end{equation*}

\vspace{-1ex}
\begin{align*}
    v_f &= v_0 + a \Delta t \\[1ex]
    &= \SI{21}{m/s} + \left(\SI{2.0}{m/s^2}\right)(\SI{5.0}{s}) \\[1ex]
    &= \boxed{\SI{31}{m/s}}

\question
The velocity vs. time data table below represents the motion of an object.

\begin{center}
    \begin{tabular}{|c|c|}
        \hline
         \textbf{Time} (s) & \textbf{Velocity} (m/s) \\ \hline
         0 & 0 \\ \hline
         1 & 1 \\ \hline
         2 & 2 \\ \hline
         3 & 3 \\ \hline
         4 & 4 \\ \hline
         5 & 5 \\ \hline
         6 & 6 \\ \hline
    \end{tabular}
\end{center}

What additional information would you need to find the force acting on the object during this time interval?

\ifprintanswers
\else
\fillwithlines{2cm}
\fi

\begin{solution}
    You can use the table to find the acceleration. By Newton's 2nd law, force is mass multiplied by acceleration. Therefore, we additionally need to know the mass of the object. 
\end{solution}

\end{solution}

% \begin{randomizechoices}
%     \choice Between 0 to 1 seconds

\question
An air bag is used to safely decrease the momentum of a driver in a car accident. Use the impulse-momentum theorem to explain how the air bag reduces the magnitude of the force acting on the driver.

\ifprintanswers
\else
\fillwithlines{2cm}
\fi

\begin{solution}
    According to the impulse-momentum theorem, $F_\mathrm{net} \Delta t = \Delta p$, an airbag reduces the force on the driver by increasing the amount of time the force acts on the driver to reduce his momentum to zero.
\end{solution}

% \begin{randomizechoices}	
%     \choice decreasing the distance over which the force acts on the driver.	
%     \choice increasing the rate of acceleration of the driver.	
%     \choice decreasing the mass of the driver.	
%     \correctchoice increasing the amount of time the force acts on the driver.
% \end{randomizechoices}

\question
The object illustrated below is moving horizontally. 

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}

    \draw[thick,fill=black!10] (1.5,0) rectangle ++(1,1);
    \fill (2,0.5) circle (2pt);
    \draw[->] (2,0.5) -- ++(0,+1.3) node[above] {$F_\mathrm{N}$};
    \draw[->] (2,0.5) -- ++(0,-1.3) node[below] {$F_g$};
    \draw[->] (2,0.5) -- ++(+2.0,0) node[above,pos=0.9] {$+$} node[right] {$F_\mathrm{A}$};
    \draw[->] (2,0.5) -- ++(-1.5,0) node[left] {$F_f$};
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

The magnitude of the applied force $F_\mathrm{A}$ is greater the magnitude of the frictional force $F_f$. The object must be moving with 

\begin{randomizechoices}
    \correctchoice constant, positive acceleration.
    \choice constant, positive velocity.
    \choice constant, negative velocity.
    \choice constant, negative acceleration.
\end{randomizechoices}

\question
The velocity vs. time graph below represents the motion of a 4 kg cart along a straight line.

\begin{center}
\begin{tikzpicture}
    \begin{axis}[width=7cm,height=5cm,
        axis lines=left,
        ymin=0, ymax=7,
        xmin=0, xmax=4,
        ylabel = {Velocity (m/s)},
        xlabel = {Time (s)},
        grid = both,
        ytick={0,1,...,7},
        xtick={0,1,...,4},
        minor x tick num=1,
    ]
    \addplot[ultra thick] coordinates {(0,6)(1,6)(1.25,3)(3.5,3)};
\end{axis}
\end{tikzpicture}
\end{center}

Explain why the change in momentum of the cart between $t = 2$ and $t = 3$ seconds is \SI{0}{\kg\cdot m/s}.

\ifprintanswers
\else
\fillwithlines{2cm}
\fi

\begin{solution}
Change in momentum ($\Delta p$) is mass ($m$) multiplied by change in velocity ($\Delta v$). During this time interval, the cart undergoes no change in velocity and therefore does not change momentum.
\end{solution}

\else
\fillwithlines{2cm}

\begin{solution}
    Because the collision is a force-pair interaction, the magnitudes of forces exerted by each cart on the other during the collision is equal in magnitude, even if the carts have different masses.
