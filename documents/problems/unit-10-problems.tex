\question
Magnetism Station Lab: Building an Electromagnet

\textbf{Objective}: Students will construct a simple electromagnet using a battery, some wire, and a nail, and they will observe different methods of manipulating the strength of the magnet.

\begin{parts}
\part 
To build your electromagnet, start by wrapping the wire around the nail a few times and then connect the two ends of the wire to the leads of the battery. With the wire connected to the battery, can you use the nail to pick up some paperclips? If so, how many can you pick up?

\part 
Now try adding a second battery (make sure the 2 batteries are properly oriented). Can you pick up more paperclips than before or less?

\part 
Now disconnect the wire and wrap it around the nail a few more times. When you reconnect the battery, can you pick up more paperclips than before or less?
\end{parts}

\question
Magnetism Station Lab: Magnetic Field Lines

\textbf{Objective}: Students will observe the shape of the magnetic field generated by a simple bar magnet using iron filings. Note: Before you begin, make sure that the magnet is separate from the apparatus and all the iron filings are settled.

\begin{parts}
\part Place the magnet in the cylinder and shake it to spread the iron filings. Draw the shape that the iron makes around the magnet below.

\begin{solutionorbox}[4cm]
    
\end{solutionorbox}


\part
Now try pulling the magnet out most of the way so that just one end is still in the cylinder. Draw the shape of the field near the magnetic pole.

\begin{solutionorbox}[4cm]
    
\end{solutionorbox}
\end{parts}

\question
Magnetism Station Lab: Electromagnet

\textbf{Objective}: Students will observe how a coil of wire can be used as an electromagnet. Note: Before you begin, make sure the coil of wire is disconnected from the battery and the metal core is placed in the center of the coil.


\begin{parts}
\part Without connecting the battery, touch the loose metal plate to the core. Is the plate attracted to the core or not?
\part Now connect the two ends of the wire to the leads of the battery. Is the metal plate attracted to the coil/iron core or not? 
\part Take the small permanent magnet and place it near the core of your electromagnet. Which pole of the magnet is attracted to the core? Which pole is repelled?
\part Disconnect the battery, reconnect it in the opposite orientation, and repeat step 3. Has the polarity of your electromagnet changed or stayed the same?
\end{parts}


\question
Magnetism Station Lab: Faraday’s Law

\textbf{Objective}: Students will observe the effects of changing magnetic fields near conductors by waving a bar magnet around a coil of wire that is connected to a voltmeter. Note: Before you begin, make sure that your voltmeter is connected to both ends of the coil and its dial is turned to the smallest voltage scale, labeled ``200m''.

\begin{parts}
\part Take the bar magnet and wave it over the top of the coil of wire. Describe what happens to the voltmeter.
\part Now try slowly moving the North pole of the magnet in and out of the coil. Is the voltage positive or negative when you push the magnet into the coil? What about when you pull the magnet out of the coil?
\part Flip the magnet around and repeat step 2 so that the South pole is now moving in and out of the coil. Is the sign of the voltage the same as before or different?
\part Now try moving the magnet faster into the coil. Does the voltage increase or decrease? What is the maximum voltage you can achieve?
\end{parts}

\question
Magnetism Station Lab: Floating Magnet Tower

\textbf{Objective}: Students will observe the interactions between permanent magnets by changing the polarity of individual magnets on a floating magnet tower. Note: Before you begin, make sure that the tower is setup so that none of the magnets are stuck together (all are repelling their neighbors).

\begin{parts}
\part 
Try taking one of the magnets off the top of the tower. What happens to the rest of the magnets on the tower?

\part 
Now flip the magnet that you have removed upside-down and place it back on the tower. Does the magnet still float? Describe what happens to the rest of the tower.

\part 
Now take all the magnets off the tower and arrange them so that all but one of the magnets are stuck together. Place the magnets back on the tower so that the individual magnet is floating on top of the rest. Is the tower taller or shorter than when you started? What configuration makes the tower the tallest?
